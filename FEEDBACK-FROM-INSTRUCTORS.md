- Chunking does not fit well, people do not see the purporse - I'd recommend cutting out the second exercise. also not clear where it is used in Carpentries material
- Parsons problems, fill in the blanks, and other guided practice examples - no examples of where they are used in materials
- Teaching exercise at the end of Day 1 is very tiring
- Course too long again
- live teaching exercise should not be at the end as any slip of the chedule leaves not enough time for that exercise - could be moved to earlier in the afternoon to have more breakout / group work
