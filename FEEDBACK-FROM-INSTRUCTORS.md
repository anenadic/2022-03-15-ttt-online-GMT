- Chunking does not fit well, people do not see the purporse - I'd recommend cutting out the second exercise. also not clear where it is used in Carpentries material
- Parsons problems, fill in the blanks, and other guided practice examples - no examples of where they are used in materials
- Teaching exercise at the end of Day 1 is very tiring
- Course too long again - gruelling schedule - with only one break in each half day and the second day ending at 17:20
- live teaching exercise should not be at the end as any slip of the chedule leaves not enough time for that exercise - could be moved to earlier in the afternoon to have more breakout / group work
- people liked episodes on motivation, equity, accessibility
- make sure homework is mentioned in the intro letter so learners can actually read/prepare in advance and not leave it for overnight reading after day 1
- blind spot around the use of stickie notes - many people never attended an in-person workshop before
- self-organised workshops do not mention creation of a workshop website as a task, but it is instead covered later on in another episode
- "Teaching Your Trajectory: Workshop 101" section title in episode "Launches and Landings" is not clear and also uses a jargon "101" that may not be universally understood 
- No time to do the creation of workshop exercise
- In episdoe on EIA, the sentence "What is a decision you might make in a workshop that could look different if you were actively considering the core value you chose?" in one of the exercises was hard to parse and understand by learners - consider rewording.
- Homework in between the days should be pitched as "reminder of what you have been reading ahead of the workshop and preparation for the following day" as it appears as we are asking people to do extra tasks after a very long first day
