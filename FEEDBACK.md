# Day 1 morning session

## Write one thing you learned that you found useful. What went well?

* Formative assessment. Using of concept map in class. Making the class interactive. I have to motivate my learners.
* The importance of Mental models during training- Understanding how to develop and use is during teaching.
* Thinking about a good class I attended (question in the beginning), and then understanding how and why that class was good (it used many guided practice tools) was very convincing.
* Concept of mental models. I liked the exercise, though it was challenging in the short time. Also learning about the differences of facts and connections and learn where the emphasis is.
* Focus on mental models felt like an important insight. Also useful to spend time considering own experiences of learning, good and bad
* It was nice learning how to ask questions from the learners
* focus on how learners learn use of exercises
* The way you engage with a large group of virtual learners by using the Etherpad was very effective! It was a good use of formative feedback while letting us interact and see one another’s ideas (without spending lots of time having each one of us speak up individually, for example)
* Very good sound, good speech. Very clear and high quaility course. I appreciate that we learn about code of conduct, scientific learning. I like that we should primarly focus on teaching how to use software that improve science.
* “Helping students to self-help”.
* To watch out for how you say things, like “what questions do you have?”
* Mental Models How to conduct formative assessments
* learning about cognitive load, made me realise I am probably trying to do too much in my workshops.
* A clearer idea of what is meant by formative assessment and examples of how to implement it. Also generally the different concepts that Carpentries applies in teaching.
* theory about cognitive load and memory?
* Good concepts discussed - learning a lot. Well paced.
* keyboard example is constructive and illustrative
* Difference between formative and summative assessment
* Pearsons Problem
* What was unclear in the material? What can we improve upon?
* The things to consider when you are teaching a class of students with different cognitive loads to ensure the information/ language is understood by all. Area of improvement: None, the training was informative.
* I am aware of the cognitive load and I found the exercise with the short term memory very nice, but I found it difficult to find solutions to ease cognitive load in teaching.
* Found it hard to apply the concept of chunking to the word-remembering exercise. Maybe it would be possible to find a better example of how this works?
* about broken models
* I missed an application of a concept map on some Carpentries related example > would have helped me to understand how to use it
* Perhaps use even more interactive/feedback strategies during the lesson for use to apply to our own teaching in the future
* Nothing unclear. Nothing to improve.
* Material is super. Would love to have a list of online resources/tools for creating polls, quizzes, note sharing etc
* Live examples
* all good so far
* Nothing
* chunking does not work for everyone and every task
* A jargon busting reference would be great - AND/OR access to your slides so we can go back a few pages if we missed a definition. E.g. Can’t remember the definitions of “concept map” vs “mental model” vs “analogy”. Don’t have any link to reference today’s slides to get a quick reminder. Same again for “formative” - I forgot the definition! E.g. in the Etherpad exercise: “Any instructional tool that generates feedback that is used in a formative way can be described as ‘formative assessment.’”
* you are doing very good. I want to be as good as you on the feedback issue
* A bit long talking sessions, so easy to drop out
